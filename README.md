# Loan Status Prediction Project 📊💰🔮

## Overview
This project aims to predict the status of loan applications using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to loan applicants, such as credit score, income, loan amount, and employment status.

## Dataset 📝
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayeshaloladia13/loan-status-prediction). It consists of historical data of loan applications along with their corresponding status (e.g., approved, rejected).

## File Descriptions 📁
- `Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `loan_dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the loan application data.

## Dependencies 🛠️
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🌊
- Scikit-learn 🧠

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayeshaloladia13/loan-status-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd loan-status-prediction
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb to execute the code and analyze the loan status prediction model.

## Model Evaluation 📈
The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the ROC curve and AUC score are used to assess the model's ability to discriminate between classes.

## Future Improvements 🚀🔍
1. Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
2. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning strategies.
3. Deploy the trained model as a web application for real-time loan status prediction.
